## 01. / Concept

**Entropy** is not a calendar.
It is a quiet representation of finitude.

The year is rendered as a finite field of days.
The past recedes. The future waits.
The present remains — briefly — and breathes.

Designed to run continuously as a **desktop wallpaper**, **PWA**, or **always-on display**, *Entropy* acts as a minimalist *memento mori* without distraction or instruction.

## 02. / Visual Semantics

* **Past (`#1a1a1a`)**
  Static. Faded. Irrecoverable.

* **Future (`#6f6f6f`)**
  Dim. Untouched. Uncertain.

* **Present (`#ffffff`)**
  Bright. Alive. Breathing (6s loop).

* **Background (`#000000`)**
  Absolute black. Pixels off.

---

## 03. / Design Principles

* No interaction required
* No configuration
* No notifications
* No sound
* No color themes

If something draws attention to itself, it does not belong.

## 04. / Features

* **OLED-Native Rendering**
  Pure black background ensures zero light bleed, minimal power usage, and long-term OLED safety.

* **Finite Time Grid**

  * **Desktop:** 52-column weekly structure (entire year visible)
  * **Mobile:** 31-column condensed layout (monthly density)

* **Present-State Breathing**
  A slow opacity modulation reinforces temporal awareness without urgency.

* **Idle-Aware Motion (OLED Care)**
  When idle, the *entire composition* (time, grid, quote) performs a ±1px drift:

  * Prevents static pixel wear
  * Preserves visual centering
  * Stops instantly on interaction

* **Subpixel Text Drift**
  Glyph-level raster variation prevents long-term text burn-in without visible movement.

* **Always-Centered Composition**
  Motion occurs *within* a fixed frame — the work never feels misaligned.

* **Installable Progressive Web App (PWA)**

  * Offline capable
  * Native-like behavior on desktop and mobile
  * Suitable for wallpaper engines and kiosk modes

---

## 05. / Technical Stack

* **HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript**
* **Zero dependencies**
* **No frameworks**
* **No trackers**
* **No analytics**

Everything runs locally. Nothing phones home.

---

## 06. / Intended Use

* Desktop live wallpaper
* Secondary monitor ambient display
* Phone home screen (PWA)
* Long-running OLED display
* Personal reflection artifact

---

## 07. / Philosophy

Entropy does not motivate.
It does not remind.
It does not optimize.

It simply **exists**, marking the irreversible passage of time — one day at a time.

## 08. / License

MIT License.
Use it. Modify it. Let it run.

Time will pass either way.

## 01. / The Concept
**Entropy** is not a calendar. It is a reality check.
It visualizes the year as a finite grid of days. The past fades into the background, the future is dim, and the present "breathes" with a subtle animation.
Designed to run permanently on a desktop or installed on a phone as a minimalist memento mori.

## 02. / Visual Logic
* **The Past (`#1a1a1a`):** Static. Faded. Gone.
* **The Future (`#6f6f6f`):** Dim. Waiting. Uncertain.
* **The Present (`#ffffff`):** Bright. Breathing (6s loop). Alive.

## 03. / Features
* **OLED Native:** Pure black (`#000`) background for zero light bleed and battery saving.
* **Responsive Grid:** * *Desktop:* 52-column wide layout (Weekly view).
    * *Mobile:* 31-column condensed layout (Monthly view).
* **Idle Drift:** To prevent OLED burn-in, the entire grid subtly "drifts" by 1px when idle.
* **Installable (PWA):** Functions as a native app on iOS and Android (offline support included).

## 04. / Tech Stack
* **Core:** HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JS
* **No Frameworks:** 0 dependencies. 100% pure code.
* **Assets:** SVG generated icons for scalability.
